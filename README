This is a package just for fun. We have been collecting interesting
code snippets from the forum http://cos.name/cn/

To install this package, you need to use the Rd2roxygen package:

library(Rd2roxygen)
## when the 'fun' directory is just under your working directory
roxygen_and_build('fun')
## or rab('fun', install=TRUE, check=TRUE)
